            <p>I pray you to tell me the first Name. <span class="speaker">Ur:</span> The first Name is BALIGON.</p>
            <p>I have to say to you, and so have I done:</p>
            <p>Now he spoke to <span class="speaker">E.T.</span>, of the matter he swore him to, at the beginning of</p>
            <p>this last instruction: and he told me afterward what Michael had willed</p>
            <p>and moved him unto. Whereat he seemed very sore disquieted: and said thus to me</p>
            <p>He said that I must betake myself to the world, and forsake the</p>
            <p>world. That is that I should marry. Which thing to do, I have no natural</p>
            <p>inclination: neither with a safe Conscience may I do it, contrary</p>
            <p>to my vow and profession. Wherefore I think and hope, there is</p>
            <p>some other meaning in these their words.</p>
            <p>You must of force keep it.</p>
            <p>You know our mind.</p>

            <p>marry</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">E.T.</span> would not willingly now deal with the former Creatures, utterly disliking</p>

            <p>he put off his hat in any prayer to God, for the Action with them: whereupon I went into my Oratory, and called unto God, for his divine help</p>
            <p>for the understanding of his laws and virtues</p>
            <p>Uriel his</p>

            <p>which he has established in and amongst his Creatures, for the</p>
            <p>benefit of mankind, in his service, and for his glory &c.</p>
            <p>And coming to the stone, <span class="speaker">E.T.</span> saw there those two, whom</p>
            <p>hitherto, we were instructed to be Michael and Uriel.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">E.T:</span> Michael and Uriel, both knelt holding up their hands: and Michael</p>
            <p>seemed to sweat water abundantly, somewhat reddish or bloodish.</p>
            <p>There came 7 Bundles down, (like faggots) from heaven ward. And Michael</p>
            <p>takes them kneeling. And Uriel takes a thing like a superaltar</p>
            <p>and lays it upon the Table: and with a thing like a censer does make</p>
            <p>perfume at the four corners of the Table: the smoke ascending up:</p>
            <p>and the censer, at the last, being set on the Table it seemed to fall</p>
            <p>through the Table.</p>
            <p>URIEL seems to be all in a white long robe tucked up: his garment</p>
            <p>full of pleats and seemed now to have wings. (which, hitherto, from</p>
            <p>the beginning of these kind of Actions he did not) and on his head</p>
            <p>a beautiful crown, with a white Cross over the Crown.</p>
            <p>Uriel takes the 7 Bundles from Michael: and with reverence</p>
            <p>lays them on the aforesaid Superaltar.</p>
            <p>A Glorious <span class="speaker">E.T:</span> There comes a man, as though he were all of perfect pure</p>
            <p>man</p>
            <p>glittering gold: sometimes seeming to have One eye, and sometimes</p>
            <p>Three.</p>
            <p>From under the Table comes a great smoke, and the place seems</p>
            <p>to shake.</p>
            <p>Uriel lies now prostrate on his face: and Michael continually</p>
            <p>prayed sweating.</p>
            <p>All creatures</p>
            <p>A description</p>
            <p>of the glorious</p>
            <p>man.</p>
            <p>Many colors in</p>
            <p>all his garments</p>
            <p>are showed in</p>
            <p>subsequent books</p>
            <p>The Glorious man seemed to open the Covering of the 7 bundles</p>
            <p>(being of diverse colored silk,) and there appeared, that these</p>
            <p>Bundles seemed to have in them, of all Creatures some, in</p>
            <p>most glorious show.</p>
            <p>The glorious man seemed to stand upon a little hill of flaming fire.</p>
            <p>He takes off, of one of the Bundles a thing like a little bird; and</p>
            <p>it hovers before him as though it had life: and then it rested</p>
            <p>upon the thing like a superaltar.</p>
            <p>This glorious man seems to be open before, and his breast somewhat</p>
            <p>spotted with blood. He has a beard forked of brownish color,</p>
            <p>his hair of his head, long, hanging down to his shoulders: but his</p>
            <p>face, for beautiful glittering, cannot be discerned. His hairs do</p>
            <p>shake, as though the wind carried them.</p>
            <p>This man blesses the bird, making a Cross over it: and so he did three</p>
            <p>times. He looks up to heaven.</p>
            <p>Now the bird, which, before, seemed to be but as big as a sparrow,</p>
            <p>seems to be as great as a swan: very beautiful: but of many colors.</p>
            <p>Now Michael looks up, and held up his hands to heaven, and says,</p>
            <p><span class="latin">Sic, Sic, Sic, Deus noster.</span></p>
            <p>Uriel, (said)-- <span class="latin">Multiplicabit omnia, benedictione sua.</span></p>
            <p>The former Beautiful man takes this fowl, sets it on the bundle, and</p>
            <p>on the place, from whence it was taken: And, now, the place</p>

            <p>where this bird stood before, seems also to be (proportionally) grown</p>

            <p>wing of the first (as though he yoked them.)</p>
            <p>This second bird, at this his first taking, was as big, as the first</p>
            <p>was become, (increased, as it showed), and it was also a very beautiful one.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">E.T:</span> All is suddenly dark, and nothing to be seen, neither Chair, nor</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">E.T:</span></p>
            <p>anything else.</p>
            <p>A voice was heard, like Michael his voice, saying,</p>
            <p>It was a bird, and is a bird, absent there is nothing</p>
            <p>but Quantity.</p>
            <p>A voice: Believe. The world is of Necessity: His Necessity</p>
            <p>is governed by supernatural wisdom,</p>
            <p>Necessarily you fall: and of Necessity shall rise again.</p>
            <p>Follow me, love me: embrace me: behold, I, AM.</p>

            <p>Now all the Darkness vanished, the man is gone. Uriel stands at</p>
            <p>the Table, and Michael sits now in his Chair: and said,</p>

            <p>You have written.</p>
            <p>The birds touch</p>
            <p>the sky and</p>
            <p>stars</p>
            <p>One thing you shall see more, as a persuasion to the Infirmity.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">E.T:</span> The two birds, which were there, before, and gone out of sight, now</p>
            <p>are showed again: but none of the bundles appear.</p>
            <p>They seem to grow to a huge bigness, as big as mountains: incredibly</p>
            <p>big: and they seem to hover up in the air, and to fly up toward</p>
            <p>heaven, and with their wings to touch the sky: And one</p>
            <p>of them with his bill seems to take stars into it: and the other bird to</p>
            <p>take them from the same bird, and to place them again in the sky.</p>
            <p>And this they did very often: and in diverse places of the heaven</p>
            <p>with great celerity.</p>
            <p>After this they seemed to fly over Cities, and towns, and to break the</p>
            <p>clouds in pieces, as they passed: and to cause all dust to fly</p>
            <p>from all walls, and towers, as they passed, and so to make them clean.</p>
            <p>And in the streets, as these two Birds flew, seemed diverse brave</p>
            <p>fellows, like bishops, and Princes and Kings, to pass: and by the</p>
            <p>wings of these birds, they were struck down. But simple</p>
            <p>silly ones, like beggars, lame and halt, children, and old aged</p>
            <p>men, and women, seemed to pass so quietly, untouched and</p>
            <p>unoverthrown of these two Birds.</p>
            <p>And then they seemed to come to a place, where they lifted up, with</p>
            <p>the ends of their wings, four Carcasses of dead</p>
            <p>men (out of the ground) with crowns on their heads: whereof</p>
            <p>one seemed to be a Child.</p>

            <p><span class="speaker">Mi:</span></p>
            <p>First these 4, seemed lean, and dead: Then they seemed quick</p>
            <p>and in good liking: And they being raised up: parted each from the</p>
            <p>other, and went into 4 sundry ways, East, West, North and</p>
            <p>South.</p>
            <p>Now these two fowls having their wings joined together, light upon</p>
            <p>a great hill: and there the First fowl gripped the earth mightily</p>
            <p>and there appeared diverse Metals, and the Fowl spurned them away,</p>
            <p>still.</p>
            <p>Then appeared an old man's head, hair and all, on; very much</p>
            <p>withered. They tossed it between them, with their feet:</p>
            <p>And they broke it: And in the head appeared (instead of the</p>
            <p>brains) a stone, round, of the bigness of A Tennis ball</p>
            <p>of 4, colors, white, black, red, and green.</p>
            <p>One of them (he that broke the skull), puts that round stone</p>
            <p>to the other's mouth or bill.</p>
            <p>The other eats or nibbles on it, and so does the other also.</p>
            <p>Now these two birds, are turned into men: And each of</p>
            <p>them have two Crowns like paper Crowns, white and</p>
            <p>bright, but seem not to be silver. Their teeth are gold,</p>
            <p>and so likewise their hands, feet, tongue, eyes, and ears likewise</p>
            <p>All gold.</p>
            <p>On each of these two men, are 26 Crowns of Gold, on their</p>
            <p>right shoulders, every of them, greater than other.</p>
            <p>They have, by their sides, Satchels, like palmers bags, full of gold,</p>
            <p>and they take it out, and seemed to sow it, as corn; going or</p>
            <p>stepping forward, like Seedmen.</p>
            <p>Then said Michael, This, is the end.</p>
            <p>The two men have vanished away.</p>
            <p>Learn the Mystery hereof.</p>
            <p>Teach us (O you spiritual Creatures.) then said Michael,</p>
            <p>Joy and health give unto the rich:</p>
            <p>Open strong locks:</p>
            <p>Be Merciful to the wicked:</p>
            <p>Pluck up the poor:</p>

            <p>I have satisfied you: Understand:</p>
            <p>Read them over: God shall give you some light in them. I have</p>
            <p>satisfied you: Both, How you shall be joined,</p>
