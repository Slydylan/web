            <p class="text-lg">her I received the following account of the</p>
            <p class="text-lg">preservation of these Books, even until they came to</p>
            <p class="text-lg">my hands, namely: That her former Husband was</p>

            <p class="text-lg">at the Plow in Lombard Street, London, and who, shortly</p>
            <p class="text-lg">after they were married, took her with him into</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Alde Street among the Joiners, to buy some</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Household stuff, where (at the Corner house) they saw</p>
            <p class="text-lg">a Chest of Cedarwood, about a yard and a half long,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">whose Lock & Hinges, being of extraordinary neat</p>
            <p class="text-lg">work, invited them to buy it. The Master of the</p>
            <p class="text-lg">shop told them it had been parcel of the Goods of</p>

            <p class="text-lg">After my fervent prayers made to God, for his merciful</p>

            <p class="text-lg">holy and mighty Angel, named Anael, (if it were</p>

            <p class="text-lg">head had beams like star beams, blazing, and spreading from it; his eyes</p>

            <p class="text-lg">There appeared also a white* dog, with a long head.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">And many other visions appeared, with this second: The first being voided</p>

            <p class="text-lg">the, commonly accounted Magic, neither studied, or exercised: But confessed</p>
            <p class="text-lg">myself, long time to have been desirous to have help in my philosophical studies</p>
            <p class="text-lg">through the Company and information of the blessed Angels of God. And there-</p>
            <p class="text-lg">upon, I brought forth to him, my stone in the frame, (which was given me by</p>
            <p class="text-lg">a friend) and I said to him, that I was credibly informed, that to it</p>
            <p class="text-lg">(in a way) were answerable <span class="latin">Aliqui Angeli boni</span>: And also that I was</p>
            <p class="text-lg">once willed by a Scryer, to call for the good Angel Anchor, to appear in that</p>
            <p class="text-lg">stone to my own sight. And therefore I desired him to call him: and (if</p>
            <p class="text-lg">he would) Anachor and Anilos likewise, accounted good Angels, for I was</p>
            <p class="text-lg">not prepared thereto. &c. He then settled himself to the Action: and</p>
            <p class="text-lg">on his knees at my desk (setting the stone before him) fell to prayer and</p>
            <p class="text-lg">entreaty &c. In the meantime, I, in my Oratory did pray, and make</p>
            <p class="text-lg">motion to God, and his good Creatures for the furthering of this Action.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">And within one quarter of an hour (or less) he had sight of one in the</p>
            <p class="text-lg">stone. but he still expected for two more: deeming this to be one of</p>
            <p class="text-lg">the three (namely Anchor Anachor Anilos). But I then came to him,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">to the stone: And after some thanks to God, and Welcome to the good</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Creature, used; I required to know his name. And he spoke plainly,</p>

            <p class="text-lg">Here upon, my scryer saw Uriel go away: and he remained out of</p>
            <p class="text-lg">sight a little while. Then he came in again: and another with</p>
            <p class="text-lg">him: and jointly these two said together, Glorify God for ever.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">And then Uriel did stand behind: and the other did sit down in the</p>
            <p class="text-lg">chair, with a sword in his right hand: all his head glistening like</p>
            <p class="text-lg">the sun. The hair of his head was long. He had wings: and all his</p>
            <p class="text-lg">lower parts seemed to be with feathers. He had a robe over his</p>
            <p class="text-lg">body: and a great light in his left hand. he said,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">- We are blessed from the beginning: and blessed be the name of</p>

            <p class="text-lg">Being desirous to proceed in this matter, by consent, we bent</p>
            <p class="text-lg">ourselves to the Action. And after that E.T. had called Uriel</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">*Agrippa has so,</p>

            <p class="text-lg">and saw him, I came to the desk from my oratory.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">There did continually appear, the chair and the Table.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">I then being afraid that any other should come into the stone,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">instead of Uriel, did earnestly require the spiritual creature</p>
            <p class="text-lg">appearing, to show who he was, and what was his name:</p>
            <p class="text-lg">At length he answered, and said to the hearing of E.T.,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Uriel is my name, with diverse called *Nariel.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Stay.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then he went away, for a while: and came again, and said thus,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">The strength of God, is always with you.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">-rather it should have been said Michael: For, Gabriel is the Prevailing Strength of God: and so, indeed strength, but of a higher degree.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Do you know, what you write?</p>
            <p class="text-lg">In two senses, I may understand it: either that the good</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Angel Gabriel is always with me, though invisibly: or else,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">that the strength, and mighty hand of God, always is my defense.</p>
            <p class="text-lg"><span class="latin">Fortitudo Dei, tecum semper est.</span></p>
            <p class="text-lg">"The Strength of God, is always with you."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">He went away again, and came again, following or waiting upon</p>
            <p class="text-lg">another: and before that other, was a man having his head all</p>
            <p class="text-lg">covered with black. Then he that came so in the middle, did sit</p>
            <p class="text-lg">down in the chair, and spoke this word following:</p>
            <p class="text-lg"><strong>Note</strong></p>
            <p class="text-lg">This was Michael, with his sword in his right hand.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then came Uriel to the man (having his head all hidden, as it</p>
            <p class="text-lg">were in a black hood) and took off that black hood: and then</p>
            <p class="text-lg">lifted up the Table cloth. He looked under it, and put it down</p>
            <p class="text-lg">again: and lifted it up again. The man stood still before</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Michael. Then Michael rose; and took off all the man's</p>
            <p class="text-lg">clothes, and left him, as it were, only in his shirt.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then Uriel took a little round Tablet, as it were, of the</p>
            <p class="text-lg">bigness of a sixpence, having</p>
            <p class="text-lg">two letters in it, thus:</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-bold">NA</p>
            <p class="text-lg">and gave it to Michael.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Uriel lifted up the Table cloth:</p>
            <p class="text-lg">and, from thence, seemed to take</p>
            <p class="text-lg">apparel, and put on the man. It seemed to be silk: and</p>
            <p class="text-lg">very full of wrinkles, or pleats. And the man kneeled, and held up</p>
            <p class="text-lg">his hands. Uriel took like a laurel bush, and set upon</p>
            <p class="text-lg">the man's head. And then the man kneeled before Michael.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Michael took the round thing, with the letters: and gave it the</p>
            <p class="text-lg">man to eat: and he did eat it.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Lo, things are covered.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then he covered the Table and</p>
            <p class="text-lg">plucked the cloth over it; down</p>
            <p class="text-lg">to the ground, on every side.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">The man rose up: And Michael</p>
            <p class="text-lg">dubbed him on the head with his sword. Then the man stood up.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">clothing, as you yourself Shall see. I am a spirit of</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Truth, and Virtue. Yes you shall see me in Power,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">and I will visit you in HOPE."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Bless you the Lord, and follow his ways, for ever.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Then he went away: and Uriel followed him.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">And then I said to my scryer: "It were good, we had ever</p>
            <p class="text-lg">some watchword, when we should not Look for any more matters</p>
            <p class="text-lg">at their hands, every time of their visiting of us."</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Whereupon, (unlooked for, by us.) he spoke again.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">"We lead time, Time leads not us:</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Put up your pen.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">The Name of God, be blessed for ever."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then they lifted up their hands heavenward (which heaven,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">appeared also in the stone) and turned toward us, and said,</p>
            <p class="text-lg"><span class="latin">Valete...</span></p>
            <p class="text-lg">"Farewell..."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">So they departed: and at their going, the chair, and the Table,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">in the stone, did seem to shake.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4"><span class="latin">Soli Deo omnis honor</span></p>

            <p class="text-lg">March 15. Thursday. Around 1 PM.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">After E.T. his calling into the stone, appeared a tall man, with a scepter</p>
            <p class="text-lg">(very great) of gold, glittering. His body all red: and out of his head, did shoot out</p>
            <p class="text-lg">beams of light, like the sunbeams.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">I being desirous, to know who he was, and his name, I requested him earnestly</p>
            <p class="text-lg">thereto. But he answered, as follows,</p>
            <p class="text-lg"><span class="latin">Invocate nomen Domini, et agnoscetis eum.</span></p>
            <p class="text-lg">"Invoke the name of the Lord, and you shall know him."</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Then I prayed the psalm, <span class="latin">Deus misereatur nostri, et benedicat nobis &c.</span></p>
            <p class="text-lg">"May God have mercy on us, and bless us," etc.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">After that, he said,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">"I am mighty."</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Salamian you</p>
            <p class="text-lg">read, in the</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note on "Salamian you read...":</strong> This is a marginal note by Dee, referring to a source like "De Elementis Magicis" (On Magical Elements) by Pietro d'Abano.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Because he delayed to declare his name. E.T. the scryer did require</p>
            <p class="text-lg">him, in the name of God the father, Jesus Christ his son, and of the holy</p>
            <p class="text-lg">ghost, to express his name: and he answered in speech.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">"So I will immediately."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then he seemed to take from his head little bright sparks, like little candle</p>
            <p class="text-lg">ends: and to stick them about the chair: and he went round about</p>
            <p class="text-lg">the chair: and then he spoke, as follows,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">"I am mighty, and working wonders: I am SALAMIAN.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">I rule in the heavens, and bear sway upon earth in his name, who be</p>
            <p class="text-lg">blessed for ever. You do doubt me. I am the servant of God,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">in his light: I serve him. I say, I serve him, with fear</p>
            <p class="text-lg">and reverence. My name is SALAMIAN: Mighty in the Sun,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">worker of worldly actions, as well internal, as external: known to</p>
            <p class="text-lg">God: whose name I know, and bless for ever."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Then appeared a big flame of fire by him in the air.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">"You know not, or you will not know, that Mammon, with</p>
            <p class="text-lg">his servants, are present about you: whose presence does hinder the presence</p>
            <p class="text-lg">of the virtues Adonai our coming. Blessed be God, in the highest.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Amen."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">He took the aforesaid flame of fire, and flung it up to the heaven</p>
            <p class="text-lg">ward.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">"Mammon is a king whom God hates: whose sect, continually</p>
            <p class="text-lg">tempt, provoke and stir up wickedness, against the Lord, and against</p>
            <p class="text-lg">his anointed. But he dies: blessed be God for ever. Drive him away."</p>
            <p class="text-lg">It is incomparably more easy for you to do. And as for my part,</p>
            <p class="text-lg">I feel neither in body, nor soul, any token of his presence or working.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Thereupon he caused the whole chamber (which we were in) to appear very</p>
            <p class="text-lg">plainly in the stone: and so there showed a great company of wicked</p>
            <p class="text-lg">spirits to be in the chamber: and among them, one, most horrible and</p>
            <p class="text-lg">grisly threatening, and approaching to our heads: and scorning and gnashing</p>
            <p class="text-lg">at us.</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note on "Mammon":</strong> Often associated with greed or earthly riches, sometimes depicted as a demon.</p>
                <p><strong>Note on "Adonai":</strong> A Hebrew name for God.</p>

            <p class="text-lg">Then he willed me very eagerly, to drive them away. And I prayed</p>
            <p class="text-lg">fervently. And there seemed One to come into the stone, which</p>
            <p class="text-lg">had very long arms: and he drove them away courageously: And</p>
            <p class="text-lg">so they were driven away.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">After that presently, came one into the stone, all white.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Salamian reached this white one a Cup.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">The white man held up the Cup: and said, as follows,</p>
