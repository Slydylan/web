    <h2 id="preface">Elias Ashmole's Preface</h2>
    <p class="small-text">(Dated: +10. April 1586, +30. April 1672)</p>
    <p>Be it remembred, That the 20th: of August 1672, I received by the hands of my Servant Samuell Story, a parcell of Dr: Dee’s Manuscripts, all written with his owne hand; vizt: his Conferences with Angells, which first began the 22th of Dec: anno: 1581, & continued to the end of May anno: 1583, where the printed Booke of the remaining Conferences (published by Dr: Casaubon) begins, & are bound up in this volume.</p>
    <p>Beside these, the Booke intituled, <em>The 48 Claves Angelicæ</em>, also, <em>Liber Scientia Terrestris Auxilii & Victoria</em> (These two being those very individuall Bookes which the Angells commanded to be burnt, & were after restored by them as appeares by the printed Relation of Dr: Dee’s Actions with Spirits pag: 418 & 419) The Booke intituled <em>De Heptarchia Mystica Collectaneorum Lib: Primus</em>, and a <em>Booke of Invocations or Calls</em>, begining with the Squares filld with letters, about the Black Cross.</p>
    <p>These 4 Bookes I have bound up in another volume.</p>
    <p>All which, were a few daies before delivered to my said Servant, for my perusall (I being then at Dr: William Lillies house at Hersham in Surrey) by my good freind Mr: Thomas Wale, one of his Majesties Warders in the Tower of London.</p>

    <p class="small-text">As a further testimony of the sence of Mr. Wales kindnes; shortly after his death, I sent for his son, & bestowed on him, one of my Deputies places in the Excise, with an allowance of 80 £ per Annum.</p>
    <p>The 5th: of Sept: following Mr: Wale (having heard of my retourne to Towne) came to my office in the Excise Office in Broadstreete, & told me he was content to exchang all the foresaid Bookes, for one of myne, vizt: <em>The Institution, Lawes & Ceremonies of the most Noble Order of the Garter</em>, to this I agreed, and provided one, which I sent him fairely bound, & gilt on the Back.</p>
    <p>On the 10th: of the said Sept: Mr: Wale came thither to me againe, & brought his wife with him, from her I received the following account of the preservation of these Bookes, even till they came to my hands, vizt: That her former Husband was one Mr: Jones a Confectioner, who formerly dwelt at the Plow in Lumbardstreet London, and who, shortly after they were married, tooke her with him into Alde streete among the Joyners, to buy some Houshold stuff, where (at the Corner house) they saw a Chest of Cedarwood, about a yard & halfe long, whose Lock & Hinges, being of extraordinary neate worke, invited them to buy it. The Master of the shop told them it had ben parcell of the Goods of Mr: John Woodall Chirurgeon (father to Mr: Tho: Woodall Late Serjant Chirurgeon to his now Majestie King Charles the 2d: (my intimate friend) and tis very probable he bought it after Dr: Dee’s death, when his goods were exposed to Sale.</p>
    <p>Twenty yeares after this (& about 4 yeares before the fatall Fire of London) she & her said husband occasionally removing this Chest out of its usuall place, thought they heard some loose thing ratle in it, toward the right hand end, under the Box or Till thereof, & by shaking it, were fully satisfied it was so: Hereupon her Husband thrust a peece of Iron into a small Crevice at the bottome of the Chest, & thereuppon appeared a private drawer, which being drawne out, therein were found divers Bookes in Manuscript, & papers, together with a litle Box, & therein a Chaplet of Olive Beades, & a Cross of the same wood, hanging at the end of them.</p>
    <p>They made no great matter of these Bookes &c: because they understood them not, which occasioned their servant Maide to wast about one halfe of them under Pyes & other like uses, which when discovered, they kept the rest more safe.</p>
    <p>About two yeares after the discovery of these Bookes, Mr: Jones died, & when the fire of London hapned, though the Chest perished in the Flames, because not easily to be removed, yet the Bookes were taken out & carried with the rest of Mrs: Jones her goods into Moorefields, & being brought safely back, she tooke care to preserve them; and after marrying with the foresaid Mr: Wale, he came to the knowledge of them, & thereupon, with her consent, sent them to me, as I have before set downe.</p>

    <h3 class="section-header">Page 1 (of Original Text Transcription)</h3>
    <p class="latin-text">Praeter alias meas extemporaneas preces, et ejaculationes ad Deum vehementiores: Haec una, maxime usitata fuit</p>
    <p class="english-translation">Among my other extemporaneous prayers and most fervent outpourings to God: this one was most customarily used.</p>
    <p class="latin-text">Oratio mea Matutina, Vespertinaque: pro Sapientia.</p>
    <p class="english-translation">My Morning and Evening Prayer: for wisdom.</p>

    <p class="latin-text">In nomine Dei Patris, Dei Filii, Dei Spiritus Sancti Amen</p>
    <p class="english-translation">In the name of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost. Amen</p>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>"In Nomine Dei Patris..."</h4>
        <p>Dee implies (here and elsewhere) that he started all his Actions with the prayers on this page. This particular phrase is the standard Western Christian formula for marking the ritual start of an Office, Service, or other ceremony or rite. It is also used within a service to mark a change of focus or as a section boundary. As an example of the former, it is used at the start of the Mass, and after it is said the priest is instructed to ignore anything else going on in the church, even the elevation of the Host at another Mass. As an example of the latter, it is used in the Anglican rite to introduce the sermon or homily.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="latin-text">Omnipotens, Sempiterne, vere, et vive Deus, in adiutorium meum intende: Domine Dominantium, Rex Regum, Jeovah Zebaoth, ad adiuvandum me festina:</p>
    <p class="english-translation">Almighty, Everlasting, True and Living God, make haste to deliver me. Lord of Lords, King of Kings Jehovah Zebaoth, make haste to help me.</p>
    <p class="latin-text">Gloria Deo, Patri, Filio, et spiritui Sancto: Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper et in saecula saeculorum: Amen.</p>
    <p class="english-translation">Glory be to God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now and forever, world without end: Amen.</p>

    <div class="sub-note">
        <p>Translator's Note: 'semper et in saecula saeculorum” is generally given in English translations as "forever, world without end” or “for ever and ever." Literally, it is “always, unto an Age of Ages", and is done in imitation of a Hebrew idiom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>"Omnipotens...Amen"</h4>
        <p>Christian communal life (monastic and secular) was, until the Reformation, built around the Daily (or Divine) Office, a series of eight liturgical services centered on the recitation of psalms and prayers. It was also common for individuals to structure their private devotions around parts of the Office.</p>
        <p>Almost every service of the Daily Office opened with the psalm verse “Deus ad adiuvandum me festina", followed by the lesser doxology. (The exception was Matins, the first service of the day, where "Deus ad adiuvandum" usually came as the second element.) See the notes below for details of the psalm and the doxology.</p>
        <p>The elaboration of the simple biblical “God” to a longer list of names and attributes is a cabbalistic practice, detailed by Reuchlin and Agrippa. See, for example, the works cited in the discussions of PELE and NA later in Liber Primus.</p>
        <p>The daily office ended with a simple "Benedicamus Domino” (“Let us bless the Lord.") Every Action in Liber Primus is closed with a more elaborate blessing (e.g. the doxology, Soli Deo honor omnis, "Glorie, thanks, and honor be unto the Almighty Trinitie", etc.)</p>
        <p>Thus, Dee not only marked out his ritual time and space using the same formula a religious service would use (see note on “In nomine" above), but also began the Actions with the standard introductory formula from the daily cycle of prayer and devotion, and ended each one with an elaboration of the traditional closing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>“Ad adiuvandum me festina” – Ps 69:2 (Vulgate), Ps 70:1 (English Bibles)</h4>
        <p class="latin-text">Vulgate ex Septuaginto: Deus in adiutorium meum intende Domine ad adiuvandum me festina;</p>
        <p class="latin-text">Vulgate ex Hebraeo: Deus ut liberes me, Domine ut auxilieris mihi festina</p>
        <p class="english-translation">BCP: Haste thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to helpe me, O Lord.</p>
        <p class="english-translation">Geneva Bible: O god, haste thee to deliver me: make haste to helpe me, O Lord.</p>
        <p class="english-translation">KJV: Make haste, O god, to deliver me; make haste to help me O LORD</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>"Gloria..."</h4>
        <p>This is the short doxology, generally used after psalms, hymns, and canticles. Generally, though, it begins "Gloria Patri” rather than “Gloria Deo, Patri."</p>
    </div>

    <p class="latin-text">Recte sapere, et intelligere doceto me, (o rerum omnium Creator,) Nam Sapientia tua, totum est, quod volo: Da verbum tuum in ore meo, (o rerum omnium Creator,) et sapientiam tuam in corde meo fige.</p>
    <p class="english-translation">Teach me to know aright and to understand (O Creator of all things) for thy wisdom is all that I desire. Give thy word in my mouth (O Creator of all things) and fix thy wisdom in my heart.</p>

    <div class="sub-note">
        <h4>"Fige"</h4>
        <p>Note that figo is also the word used for driving nails.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="latin-text">O Domine Jesu Christe (qui sapientia vera es, aeterni et Omnipotentis tui Patri) humilime tuam oro Divinam Majestatem, expeditum mihi ut mittere digneris, alicuius pii, sapientis expertiquie, Philosophi auxilium, ad illa plenissime intelligenda perficiendaque, quae maximi valoris erunt ad tuam laudem et gloriam amplificandam: Et si Mortalis nullus iam in terris vivat, qui ad hoc munus aptus sit: vel qui ex aeterna tua providentia, ad istud mihi praestandum beneficium assignatus fuerit: Tunc equidem humilime, ardentissime et constantissime a tua Divina Majestate requiro, ut ad me de caelis mittere digneris bonos tuos Spirituales Ministros, Angelosque, videlicet Michaëlem, Gabrielem, Raphaëlem ac Urielem: et (ex Divino tuo favore) quoscunque, alios, veros, fidelesque tuos Angelos, qui me plene et perfecte informent et instruant, in cognitione, intelligentiaque vera et exacta, Arcanorum et Magnalium tuorum (Creaturs omnes tuas, illarumque naturas, proprietates, et optimos usus, concernentium) et nobis Mortalibus scitu necessariorum; ad tui nominis laudem, honorem, et gloriam; et ad solidam meam, aliorumque (per me,) plurimorum tuorum fidelium consolationem: et ad Inimincorum tuorum confusionem, et subversionem. Amen.</p>
    <p class="english-translation">O Lord Jesus Christ (who art the true wisdom of thine eternal and almighty Father), I most humbly beseech thy Divine Majesty, that thou deignest to send me the speedy aid of some pious, wise and expert philosopher for the complete understanding and accomplishing of that which will be of the greatest worth for the increase of thy praise and glory: And if there should be no Mortal now living on earth who might be fitting for this gift, or who by thy divine providence might be assigned to the fulfillment of this my prayer, then equally most humbly, most ardently and most constantly, I request from thy Divine Majesty that thou deignest to send to me from the heavens thy good Spiritual Ministers and Angels, which is to say, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel: and (out of thy Divine favor) whatever other true and faithful of thy Angels, who might completely and perfectly inform and instruct in the knowledge and in the true and exact intelligence of thy Secrets and Miracles (concerning all thy Creatures and their natures, properties and best uses) the understanding of which is necessary to us Mortals; to the praise, honor and glory of thy name and to my thorough consolation and (through me) that of many others of thy faithful, and to the confusion and subversion of thine enemies. Amen.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>"Spirituales"</h4>
        <p>"Spirituales" has senses of form (as in spiritual beings – i.e. Angels) and function (as in 'Spiritual Father', when applied to a priest.)</p>
    </div>

    <p class="latin-text">Angelus sive Intelligentia, nunc toti mundo praedominens</p>
    <p class="english-translation">The Angel or Intelligence now ruling over the whole world.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>"Intelligentia"</h4>
        <p>In a theological sense intelligentia is a 'a non-corporeal Being or Intelligence', and is commonly used for angels and spiritual beings. Agrippa, Ficino, and Aquinas use it in this sense. 'Intelligentia' can also be a ‘rational activity, rational comprehension', in a more philosophical than theological way (also used by Aquinas and various neoplatonizing Christians.) Here, it is easy to opt for the former meaning, though in Liber Tertius the choice is not so clear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <h4>"Annael praedominens”</h4>
        <p>Oddly enough, Trithemius in his De Septem Secundeis (also called Chronologia Mystica) says that Gabriel is the Angel currently (in 1582) presiding over the world. Annael is problematic in other ways as well. (See below.)</p>

    <p class="english-translation">Etymology: The Gracious/Afflicted Merciful ... of God.</p>
    <div class="sub-note">
        <p>Translator's Note: This is a little problematic, since there is no noun here. (The four other Angels in the Note are all described with nouns.) It could be, for instance, the “merciful nature” or "merciful things” of God. “Gratiosa/afflicta” can be explained in Christian terms, in which God's mercy is both gracious (in many senses of the word) and suffering (because of the Passion and Death of Christ.)</p>

    <p class="latin-text">Castra metatur Angelus Domini, in Circuitu timentium eum,...</p>
    <p class="english-translation">The Angel of the Lord measures out his camp, encircling those that fear him, ...</p>
    <div class="note">
        <h4>“Castra metatur” – Psalm 33:8 (Vulgate); Psalm 34:7 (English)</h4>
        <p class="latin-text">Ex Septuaginto: vallabit angelus Domini in circuitu timentium eum et eripeit eos</p>
        <p class="latin-text">Ex Hebraeo: circumdat angelus Domini in gyro timentes eum et eruet eos.</p>
        <p class="english-translation">BCP: The Angel of the Lord tarieth round about them that feare him: and delivereth them.</p>
        <p class="english-translation">KJV: The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p>
        <p class="english-translation">Geneva Bible: The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them, that feare him, and deliuereth them.</p>
        <p>Dee's version is slightly different from either of these. “Metatur” has the sense of surveying or measuring out an area, unlike either ‘circumdat' or 'vallabit.' The more precise word is consonant with the angelically directed mathematical construction and subdivision of the Sigillum Aemeth in the second book. It could also be that Dee the mathematician found the surveying term more congenial than the less technical wordings in the Vulgate.</p>

    <p class="english-translation">Whatever is considered useful to man is more easily (immeasurably so) entreated from God, or from good spirits, etc.</p>
    <div class="note">
        <h4>"Facilius...."</h4>
        <p>The Bacon work is variously titled <em>Epistola Fratris Rogerii Baconis de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae</em>, et <em>de Nullitate Magiae</em> or <em>Epistola Rogerii Bacon de Potestae Artis et Naturae</em>. Dee gives yet a third notion of the title. (I have picked and chosen the manuscript variants that most closely match Dee's text. One of Dee's copies seems to have embodied a state of the text not otherwise known – see Roberts and Watson, p. 62, and their notes on catalog numbers D4 and DM163. One wonders whether Dee's text was lacking <em>de Nullitate Magiae</em> -- “on the Nullity of Magic", or whether he suppressed the thought.)</p>
        <p class="latin-text">Et adhuc erratur, quando per invocationes, et deprecationes, et sacrificia nituntur homines eos placare et adducere pro utilitate vocantium; facilius enim sine comparatione a Deo impetrandum foret, vel a bonis spiritibus, quicquid homini debet utile reputare.</p>
        <p class="english-translation">And still it is mistaken, when men strive, through invocations and prayers and sacrifices, to please and persuade them for the benefit of the callers; for it is incomparably easier to obtain from God, or from good spirits, anything which ought to be deemed useful for man.</p>
        <p class="sub-note">Whitby (p 202-23) cites a 1659 English translation <em>Frier Bacon his Discovery of the Miracles of Nature, and Magick</em>, about which he notes “This edition bears the notice on the title-page that it has been 'faithfully translated out of Dr. Dee's own copy, by T.M.” The translation could just as well have been made out of the Froben edition of 1618, which also claims to be taken from Dee's copy – see Roberts and Watson above. "...without all question the way is incomparable more easie to obtain any thing, that is truly good for men, of God, or good angels, then of wicked Spirits" (pp.3-4)</p>

        <p class="english-translation">Geneva Bible: Is it not because there is no God in Israel, that ye goe to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</p>
        <p>Dee is just adding biblical support to the Bacon text – the children of Israel only consult a false god because they no longer know their own God.</p>

        <p>Translator's Note: “Praepositus” is literally ‘placed over' or 'set over', but can also mean a chief or commander. In classical Latin, it is used for the governor of a province.</p>
        <p>Annael (See Trithemius, De Septem Secundeis §2.) In Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia, this Angel is named Haniel. (See for instance the tables in II.10 and II.12, and III.10 ‘Of Divine Emanations'.)</p>
        <p>Annael/Haniel/Anael is problematic in both primary and secondary sources. The attribution to Venus is constant in Agrippa, and seems likely in Picatrix III.ix.23, but the spelling, derivation, and meaning of the name seem obscure. A Dictionary of Angels claims that Annael and Haniel are synonymous, but gives very different descriptions under the two names.

Arithmetic reasoning proves this; for if we in such a way multiply Ehieh by Ehieh, four hundred forty one will arise, which is at once Emeth, that is 'true' or 'truth' and Adonai Shalom "Peace of the Lord."</p>
